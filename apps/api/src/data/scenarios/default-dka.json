Three need your urgent attention: one has been vomiting and feeling unwell, another has had a sudden PV bleed, and a third is worried about reduced fetal movements. Four other women are progressing normally in labour or postnatal care. You need to assess, investigate, and manage each patient appropriately. Remember to prioritise based on clinical urgency.",
